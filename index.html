    <h1> Happy late valentines day :D (Indigo blue and Jade pink day‚ù§Ô∏è)</h1>
    <p>Dear iris so basicly in short i already told u this yesterday-- or well for me today cuzz im coding this at 23:10..... but uh i mean u said u appreciated the gesture and i know u dont want me to actualy make it but im still gunna since well u said U APPRECIAETD THE THOUGHT SO IMAGINE HOW MUCH ULL APPRECIATE IF I ACTUALY MAKE IT :D. So this is basicly a late valentines day websit because im a donkey and was scared to ask u lol but u already knew that sooooooo yeah. im calling this Indigo blue and Jade pink day (i you nono know why i name it that u can ask I HAVE THOUGHT THIS TRU CAREFULLY THERES A REASON FOR THE NAME). And also i kinda figured why would i celebrate having you in my life on the same day as everyone else-like your literly the best so obviously im gonna do it on a unique day for you (i was totaly not just a scaredy catü•∫)</p>
    <br>
    <p>And oh one thing i do think you deserve to know, i am using some ai tools to speed this proces up a bit since well I LITERLY HAVE 2 HOURS TO MAKE THIS SO ID RATHER PUT MORE EFFORT INTO THE TEXT SOOOO YEAH WELL ANYWAY. I wanted to start by telling you that first of all if you dont think u deserve this website, no ur right u deserve way better i wish i could give u so much more maybe a card and a gift basked but im not a wizard so i cant do thatüòû. Anyway i just wanted to tell you that ur super sweet awesome and perfect ur like woah i dont know how to discribe it ur out of this world like somoetimes im lik HOW IS IRIS REAL THIS LEVEL OF PERFECTNESS SHOULD BE ILLIGAL WTH HOWWHOWHWHOHOWHOWOHWOHWHOWOWOHWHOWOW HOWWWWWWW. So heres a random story cuzz i STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN IT OFF OF MY CHEST GASDKFJADKSL anyway so basicly before well you blocked me for a bit (its not about that just keep reading pls) i made u a tool kind of like a chrome extention where u could click it and a sweet message would pop up incase u where down, if youd like i can make u an improved version? And iris everytime you keep saying "OMG NO BUT THATS SO MUCH" dear iris i quite LITERLY study and work hard to make sure i can earn more money soon just to spoil u, u mean alot to me like alotototototot i hope you know that iris if the whole world is against u i would quite literly be dead cuzz i would ALWAYS be for you (unless well you like kill someone for a bad reason but u wouldnt do that LOLOLOLL) also im not talking in caps to show u a bit more seriousness and to make sure you can kinda feel how much effort i put into writing this. I honestly have no idea if your gonna like this or not but hey just be happy i really try my best:D. And i thnk its funny that u keep saying "OMG WAIT NO THATS SO MUCH" whenever i wanna give u something like IRIS DEAR IRIS STOP SAYING THAT YOU ARE LITERLY WORTH MORE THEN ANYTHING I COULD EVER GET YOU FJADKLKDFJKL I WOULD LITERLY SPENT INFINITE MONEY ON YOU IF I COULD BUT WELL INFNITE MONEY DOESNT REALLY EXIST unless ur immortal because then u have infinite time so technicly u have infinite money ANYWAYS THAT WAS JUST UH WELL i like theoretical concepts okayüòû ANYWAYSSSSSS HERES HOW JUUL SEES YOU, i see u prettier then the night sky, cuter and sweeter then bunnys, funny as me doing a handsstand between 2 tables and falling on my back infront of my whole class (yes this actualy hapend....) and last but not least i see you as clean code with perfect optimalisation (AKA, perfect computer code cuzz well ur perfect :> <33333333333333 i like sending u hearts lol)</p>

        <br>
        <p>And also sorry i didnt ask u on regular valentines day i think maybe u would have liked that a bit better but i was a bit scaredy cat so yeah ill just do it in my own dumb way :D O and a qeustion could u maybe help me pick the initial I necklace? that way its even more special </p>

        <h1> What do i like about you?</h1>
        <p>Well theres a bunch of things i mean where do i start ill start with outside and then ill do inside, save the most important for last :D. So first off i really like your voice i dont know why but its kinda calming (SORRY IF THAT SOUNDS WEIRD I PROMISE U I DO NOT MEAN THAT IN A WEIRD OR BAD WAY) and i also really like ur eyes and ur hair and ur face and ur hands (when u showed panda i saw ur hand :> (this was a long while back), i really LOVE your style i dont know the name but i rlly like it, and now lets do what i like about u from the inside, first of all i like ur personality, its sweet kind calming and perfect i just really like it, i also really love your humor and your taste in things, for example pandas are actualy one of my favorite animals aswell (bunnies, pandas, penguins, deers) and i also think ur very funny hihi u make me laugh all the time lol, and i also find it kinda very sweet how u dont want to take anything from me XD because u think i gave u "to much"(like iris shut it its never to much if its about u u goose). By the way, i really dont give a fuck what anyone thinks about u or what they say about u, i KNOW that your a pretty, sweet, kind, funny and caring person. THATS A FACT. OH ALSO DID I TELL YOU U HAVE GREAT MUSIC TASTE? LANA DEL RAY KINDA MAKES THE SAME KINDA MUSIC I LISTEN TO! I LISTEN TO LIKE EMOTIONAL HAPPY PAPPY MUISC OR JUST WELL MUSIC LIKE CRYSTAL CASTLES LIL PEEP OR SOMETIMES I LISTEN TO A BIT MORE ENERGETIC SONGS (good example is feel it from d4vd)</p>

        <br>
        <p>and iris to be honest i hope you know that i really love you alot, i love you alot alot im about to cry (in a good way) u mean alot to me i know i say a bunch of compliments and sutff all the time but to me those arent compliments to me thats my thoughts to me thats how u are  to me ur everything to me ur the sweetest kindest person i have ever met i dont care if you blocked me for a year or 10 years i still would have said, its okay can we play something now? iris i know i say it alot i love you but i do genuinly mean it your a very dear person to me even if you dont realise that iris i do really love you with every bone and bloodcell in my body, i dont really know if u think this is stupid or cringe but i literly cried typing this part out so please know i really really care about u. I will always be here for you and i promise you iris u will be my favie forever‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

        <br>
        <b><p>I hope this kind of shows u how much i really care about you and if u still dont realise, whilst u where gone for a couple of months i kept repeating to myself "if this makes iris happy its okay" but then i checked ur repoasts and bam u where sad and that made me sad, all i want for you is to be happy and to feel cared for. I seriously dont know why i feel this so strongly or well yeah i mean who wouldnt ur litelry super perfect but its very its very interesting i havent really felt happy in a really long while ever since my sister got sick and u kinda u kinda fix that just by being there idk maybe this is stupid but i really really love you. (most)</p></b>
        <b><p>Note: yes i actualy cried whilst typing those parts. (not in a bad way)</p></b>
        <b><p>Extra Important note: sorry if this is a bit to much or if this makes u feel any kind of pressure, please dont feel pressured u can do whatever you want okay? im just telling you this cozz i would feel kinda bad if i didnt say anything back or if i didnt know how to respond, so iris please dont feel pressured its all okay, pinky promise. Your a very amazing person, i hope you realise this.</p></b>

        <br>
        <p>Small poem ish kinda thing before i get into the fun stuff: iris, in a world full of zeros and ones your a 2, unique, one of a kind, perfect. Your also kind of like the northern lights, In a cold world you make everyones day better just by existing.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Last one before i move on to the next thing cuzz otherwise u might not finish it. If you where a bible verse you would be Proverbs 3:15</p>

         


        <h1> ALRIGHTTT FUN STUFFFF</h1>
        <p>Also i named it "Indigo blue and Jade pink day because" indigo starts with i (i for iris) and then its my fav color nex tto it, blue and then for pink the exact same but with ur fav color and my initial :D</p>
        <br>
